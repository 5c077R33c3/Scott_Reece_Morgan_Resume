			<h1>Bio</h1>
			<div class = "paragraph">
				<p>
				My name is Scott-Reece Morgan, I'm the eldest son in a family of four and I currently work 
				at M.A.V Technical services, a home appliance repair company. I studied Mechanical Engineering
				at the University of the Witwatersrand and currently reside in the south of Johannesburg.
				</p>
	
				<p>
				I am passionate about God and His Son Jesus Christ, because of this I seek to serve and try my
				best in everything that I do. I have a zeal for life and all things living. I really enjoy 
				gardening (toes in the dirts) and cycling (wind in my hair) and am interested in getting back 
				into art.		
				</p>
		
				<p>
				I am motivated by excellence, and honestly try to apply myself in everything I do. This causes
				causes some pain on my part as the easiest way is often not the best way. What I would most
				like to do is serve God in whatever He has called me to do.
